There are simple solutions for this, however. For example, secure passwords can be randomly generated and printed on the device\u2019s serial number sticker. If the device is not going to be easily accessible during normal operation, consider providing such a sticker inside the manual or quick start guide, which can be taken out and put somewhere the user will not forget. Of course, there will always be scenarios where customers forget or lose passwords, so system recovery methods, such as a physical reset button which enters a password recovery mode when pressed, should also be securely implemented. \n\nAny secret (symmetric) or private (asymmetric) cryptographic keys should also be managed as unique for each device or application. There are a few ways in which cryptographic keys can be determined even when they are apparently being stored and managed inside a secure device. Often these methods are not worthwhile for extracting keys from a single device, but if the same key is used in thousands of devices, the economics of such an attack change considerably.",

Researchers who discover serious vulnerabilities and report them responsibly provide a service to the industry similar to people who discover safety flaws in automobiles and other safety-critical machinery. Legitimate security research may be hindered by excessive legislation. One way to differentiate between research and unethical hacking is to mandate responsible disclosure of discovered vulnerabilities. Responsible disclosure requires the researcher to first notify the manufacturer or governing authorities and allow reasonable time for the vulnerability to be independently verified and fixed before going public with a system hack. Another, less desirable, approach might be to require researchers to first register with a government office or the manufacturer before attempting to break into a device.",

Credential generation includes any steps required to create the credential itself, or to enable or direct the entity to create the credential. Then, during credential binding, the credential, or the means to create it, is associated to the identity assigned to the entity. Finally, during credential issuance, the credential, or the means or directive to create it, is delivered to the entity using a secured and auditable process. The specific process depends on the organizational policy for the environment.",

Another potential solution is the usage of of Physical Unclonable Function (PUFs) that serves as unique digital fingerprint of a hardware device. PUFs can also enable other functionalities such as secure key storage. Protection against such data leakage patterns is non-trivial since devices are inherently resource-constrained. An open question is whether there are any viable techniques to protect IoT devices and the data in the devices in such an adversarial model.",

        "Notes": "Many IoT devices are resource-constrained and often deployed in unattended environments. Some of these devices can also be purchased off-the-shelf or online without any credential-provisioning process. Therefore, an attacker can have direct access to the device and apply advanced techniques to retrieve information that a traditional black box model does not consider. Example of those techniques are side-channel attacks or code disassembly.",

BITAG recommends that IoT device manufacturers secure communications using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) [96,97,98]. Some devices can perform symmetric key encryption in near-real time. In addition, Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) provides additional options for securing traffic to and from resourceconstrained devices. If devices rely on a public key infrastructure (PKI), then an authorized entity must be able to revoke certificates when they become compromised, as web browsers and PC operating systems do [99,100,101,102,103,104,105]. Cloud services can strengthen the integrity of certificates issued by certificate authorities through, for example, participating in Certificate Transparency [106]. Finally, manufacturers should take care to avoid encryption methods, protocols, and key sizes with known weaknesses. \n\nVendors who rely on cloud-hosted support for IoT devices should configure their servers to follow best practices, such as configuring the TLS implementation to only accept the latest TLS protocol versions.",

A custom Cellular base station currently costs under 1,000 USD to build, but the resultant power only allows the interception of messages in the local area.

A SIM card, by design, is a removable component. Anyone with physical access to the oil well monitoring device can extract the SIM card and place it in a laptop. If the laptop has software on it that can simulate the functionality of the oil device, the back-end server will be unable to differentiate between the actual oil device and the laptop. Yet, the laptop will be authenticated to the Cellular network because of the SIM card! Thus, the Cellular network has authenticated the SIM card, but not the laptop.",

The system threat analysis enables the creation of the security objectives for the system, derived from regulations and standards. From these objectives, the applicable security policies are selected based on the industry vertical, customer base, geographic location and other considerations. The security policy describes the overall business-risk considerations and defines the guidelines for securing the day-to-day proper functioning of the system. This policy is then transformed into a security model, and determines and drives requirements to the functionality of the building blocks of the security framework. For example, each machine-level security policy specifically covers the security policies associated with the endpoint and the devices it may be connected to or in control of.",

The process of establishing trust through endpoint authentication, or identity assertion of the remote endpoint, has several steps. First, an attestation must be made that the credentials are of the proper level of strength, and that they are in the possession of the appropriate entity. Then, the actual value of data in the credential is evaluated for correctness. Finally, validity of the credential must be tested to ensure that the credential is not suspended, revoked or expired.\nAll successful authentication attempts do not result in the same level of trust in the identity of the remote endpoint. There are different levels of entity identity assurance based on what type of credential is applied to that authentication, how the credential is stored, and what actual authentication technique is implemented.\nStrong cryptographic credentials are recommended for most endpoints. In addition, credentials should be stored in the strongest storage available, ideally in trusted hardware.",

The root cause usually is based around two issues: first, computing systems are deterministic, meaning the same program, given the same inputs, will produce the same output every time; second, we as human beings are not very good at spotting a lack of randomness. \n\nInput from an embedded device cannot be solely relied on to produce good random numbers. It is often best to take input from various sources. One of these may be a standard random function, but other sources also include the least significant bits of an A/D input, network traffic timing, hard-disk seek timing, millisecond data from a real-time clock source, user input timing, etc. These can then be combined and provided as a seed to a pseudo-random number generator, such as those outlined in NIST SP 800-90A.",

Such solutions can also be used to prevent unauthorized use of removable media as well as locking down device configuration and settings, while also de-escalating user privileges where needed. Such solutions can also provide auditing and alerting functions, helping monitor logs and security events.

The interface to the hardware-level privilege controls of a processor are often managed by the OS, such as Linux, but they can also be controlled even if a device does not use a complex OS (for example, if it uses a simple function executive, or cut-down RToS, instead). \n\nWhenever possible, keep the use of root or supervisor-level privileges in embedded systems to an absolute minimum, and maintain secret data, such as cryptographic keys, at the highest level of privilege (hardest to access). Similar rules hold true for apps and cloud-based systems: keep the use of elevated privileges to a minimum, and try to isolate functions as their own user or privilege set.",

This includes code that may not be normally executed; even if the code is not used, having it within the device can lead to security problems down the road. \n\nFor similar reasons, it is essential to remove debug and development code from the device prior to shipping. This is often done with isolating \u201cifdef\u201d statements, which can automatically remove such features during compile time. Although it is understandable to want features in the code in case there are problems in production, it is often more likely that such features will become a source of vulnerability as they provide access and information that would not normally be provided in the end-user environment.",

        "Recommendation Extracted from Linked Source": "In powering up, each device boots and runs some code. In that context, it is crucial that we ensure devices only do what we programmed them to do, and ensure that others cannot reprogram them to behave maliciously. In other words, the first step in protecting a device is to protect the code to be sure the device only boots and runs code that you want it running. Fortunately, many chipmakers already build \u201csecure boot\u201d capabilities into their chips. Similarly, for \u201chigher level\u201d code, a number of time-proven, opensource, and client-side libraries like OpenSSL can easily be used to check signatures of code, and accept code only if it comes from an authorized source. In that context, signing firmware, boot images, and higherlevel embedded code are all increasingly common, including signing the underlying software components such as any operating system, and not just applications, but all code on the device. This approach can ensure that all critical components, sensors, actuators, controllers, and relays are all properly configured to only run signed code and never run unsigned code.",

        "Notes": "Ideally firmware should be validated on each boot to ensure it has not been altered since being installed. This can be achieved when there is a signature across all firmware anyway, which may be the case if the system runs a simple function executive, but is significantly more difficult when it is a complex operating system (OS), such as Linux. Validating all of the different files, scripts, etc. that go into ensuring a complex OS runs correctly is complicated. Potential solutions include the validation of the device bootloader (from a hardware root of trust, which requires support in the processor being used) and then using that bootloader to validate an OS image which is unpacked and installed. \n\nOf course, this all takes time. But it is useful to prevent things like Ransomware which may look to install software that renders a device inoperative until a ransom amount is paid.",

These changes may include for example: new, enhanced, and upgraded system capability; maintenance and sustainment activities; and reconfiguration. Although it is not possible to plan for every aspect of system evolution, system upgrades and changes can be anticipated by analyses of mission or business strategic direction; anticipated changes in the threat environment; and anticipated maintenance and sustainment needs.",

Since the IoT Service Provider cannot control the security a partner has implemented in their internal services and network, the IoT Service Provider can only enforce that data contributed to a partner is trafficked in a secure manner. Without this definition, the partner can enforce insecure configurations that may expose user data to adversaries while the data is still under the control of the IoT Service Provider. By enforcing stringent security controls for the communications channel, the IoT Service Provider proves it is doing everything it can do to enforce security until the data is out of its control.\n\n\"Updated link/version \nJuly 2020\"",

This is because Internet connectivity may be disrupted due to causes ranging from accidental misconfiguration or intentional attack (e.g., a denial of service attack); device function should be robust in the face of these types of connectivity disruptions. IoT devices that have implications for user safety should continue to function under disconnected operation to protect the safety of consumers. In these cases, the device or backend system should notify the user about the failure.\n\nWhen possible, device manufacturers should make it easy for users to disable or block (e.g.,with a firewall) various network traffic without hampering the device\u2019s primary function.",

For such reasons, strategic threats require strategic mitigation technologies. Security analytics can leverage security telemetry from devices and network hardware to help provide an understanding of what is happening in the environment, including detection of stealthier threats. \n\nEqually importantly, \u201cmonitoring\u201d and analytics can often be deployed as an interim solution in environments where upgrading devices to conform to the first three cornerstones above will take years. Examples of such environments include legacy devices such as industrial control systems (manufacturing, oil and gas, utilities) that cannot be modified until an end-to-end replacement system is ready, automotive cars already on the road whose deeply embedded microcontrollers obviously cannot be \u201ctorn out and replaced,\u201d and healthcare environments where suppliers prohibit hospitals from modifying the equipment to add security. In such cases, anomaly detection solutions can be extremely valuable. The deterministic nature of many IoT networks allows the system to be baselined and deviations quickly identified. The wide variety of industrial and IoT protocols can make the problem harder, but newer techniques using advanced machine learning can allow the problem to be solved. Considering that many IoT systems have high demands on availability, this solution is less invasive in \u201cdetect\u201d mode while ensuring that any false positives do not bring down the system.",

Validate all data from untrusted\nsources (e.g., Databases, file streams, etc.)\nThere should be a centralized input validation routine for the application\nSpecify proper character sets, such as UTF-8, for all sources of input\nEncode data to a common character set before validating (Canonicalize)\nAll validation failures should result in input rejection\nDetermine if the system supports UTF-8 extended character sets and if so, validate after UTF-8 decoding is completed\nValidate all client provided data before processing, including all parameters, URLs and HTTP header content (e.g. Cookie names and values). Be sure to include automated post backs from JavaScript, Flash or other embedded code\nVerify that header values in both requests and responses contain only ASCII characters\nValidate data from redirects (An attacker may submit malicious content directly to the target of the redirect, thus circumventing application logic and any validation performed before the redirect)\nValidate for expected data types\nValidate data range\nValidate data length\nValidate all input against a \"white\" list of allowed characters, whenever possible\nIf any potentially hazardous characters must be allowed as input, be sure that you implement additional controls like output encoding, secure task specific APIs and accounting for the utilization of that data throughout the application . Examples of common hazardous characters include:\n< > \" ' % ( ) & + \\ \\' \\\"\nIf your standard validation routine cannot address the following inputs, then they should be checked discretely\nCheck for null bytes (%00)\nCheck for new line characters (%0d, %0a, \\r, \\n)\nCheck for \u201cdot-dot-slash\" (../ or ..\\) path alterations characters.
