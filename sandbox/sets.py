    These are just some thoughts and experiments:

    Attempt to help mapping by finding elements (primitives) which then
    are categorized in different sets:
    e.g.:

               {personal, device, calibration, sw}data, password

    sets: transfer, management, software integrity, privacy,
          authenitcity, attack surface,
